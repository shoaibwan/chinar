# Background Image Instructions

Place your background image here with the name: **background.jpg**

## Specifications:
- **File name**: background.jpg (or background.png)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher (2560x1440, 3840x2160)
- **File size**: Optimize for web (aim for under 500KB for JPG, under 1MB for PNG)
- **Content**: Should be relevant to charity work, community service, or your organization

## Where it's used:
The image is used as a background for the home/hero section of the website.

## Fallback System:
- **Priority 1**: Video background (background.mp4) will load first
- **Priority 2**: If video fails or doesn't exist, this image will display
- **Priority 3**: If neither exists, the colored overlay will show

## Tips:
- Use high-quality images that represent your mission
- Ensure important subjects are centered (text will overlay on top)
- Slightly darker images work better with white text overlay
- Test on mobile devices to ensure it looks good at all sizes

## Example:
```
/public/images/background.jpg  <-- Place your file here
```

You can have BOTH video and image files. The website will intelligently choose which to display based on what's available and what loads successfully.
