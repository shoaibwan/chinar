# Background Video Instructions

Place your background video here with the name: **background.mp4**

## Specifications:
- **File name**: background.mp4
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended for best compatibility)
- **Recommended resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or 1280x720 (HD)
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (video will loop continuously)
- **File size**: Optimize for web (aim for under 5MB if possible, max 10MB)
- **Frame rate**: 24-30 fps
- **Audio**: Not needed (video will be muted for autoplay)

## Where it's used:
The video is used as an animated background for the home/hero section of the website.

## Fallback System:
- **Priority 1**: This video will try to load first
- **Priority 2**: If video fails to load or doesn't exist, background image will display
- **Priority 3**: If neither exists, the colored overlay will show

## Tips for Best Results:
1. **Compression**: Use video compression tools to reduce file size while maintaining quality
   - Tools: HandBrake, Adobe Media Encoder, or online compressors
2. **Content**: Choose video that:
   - Represents your charity mission
   - Has slow, smooth movement (not too fast/jerky)
   - Works well as a background (not too distracting)
3. **Optimization**:
   - Remove audio track to reduce file size
   - Use H.264 codec for best browser compatibility
   - Test on mobile devices (some may fall back to image)
4. **Looping**: Make sure the end flows smoothly back to the beginning

## Browser Behavior:
- Desktop browsers: Video will autoplay (muted)
- Mobile browsers: May show image fallback to save data
- Low bandwidth: Image fallback may display instead

## Example:
```
/public/videos/background.mp4  <-- Place your file here
```

You can have BOTH video and image files. The website will intelligently choose which to display based on:
- File availability
- Loading success
- Browser capabilities
- User's connection speed

## Video Compression Commands (Optional):
If you have FFmpeg installed:
```bash
# Compress to web-optimized MP4
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset slow -vf scale=1920:1080 -an background.mp4

# For smaller file size (lower quality)
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset slow -vf scale=1280:720 -an background.mp4
```
